# This assignment will assess your skills and knowledge to create interactive GUI applications that employ event handling mechanisms.

Context: You have been assigned to develop a GUI application for a Student Management System. The application should provide a user-friendly interface for administrators to interact with student records, course enrollment, and grades. The GUI should be implemented using Java's GUI frameworks such as Swing or JavaFX. Event handling mechanisms should be employed to respond to user interactions, and the interface should update dynamically to reflect changes in student records.

Requirements:
GUI Design:

Design an intuitive and user-friendly GUI interface for the Student Management System.
Implement the GUI using Java's GUI frameworks such as Swing or JavaFX.
Include appropriate components such as labels, text fields, buttons, tables, and menus to display and interact with student records, course enrollment, and grades.
Ensure that the GUI is aesthetically pleasing, easy to navigate, and logically organized.
Student Management Functionality:

Provide functionality to add new students, update student information, and view student details through the GUI interface.
Implement event handlers for relevant GUI components, such as buttons or menu items, to perform the corresponding actions.
When the "Add Student" button/menu item is clicked, display a form to enter the student's information and add the new student to the system.
When the "Update Student" button/menu item is clicked, display a form to select a student and update their information.
When the "View Student Details" button/menu item is clicked, display a table or another suitable component to show a list of students and their details.
Course Enrollment Functionality:

Include functionality to enroll students in courses through the GUI interface.
Implement event handlers to respond to actions such as selecting a course and enrolling a student.
When a course is selected from a dropdown menu or list, display a list of students eligible for enrollment.
Allow administrators to select a student from the list and enroll them in the chosen course.
Grade Management Functionality:

Incorporate functionality to assign grades to students through the GUI interface.
Implement event handlers to respond to actions such as selecting a student, selecting a course, and assigning a grade.
When a student is selected from a dropdown menu or list, display a list of courses they are enrolled in and their current grades.
Allow administrators to select a course and assign a grade to the selected student.
Dynamic Interface Updates:

Ensure that the GUI interface updates dynamically to reflect changes in student records, course enrollment, and grades.
When a new student is added or information is updated, update the student list or details display accordingly.
When a student is enrolled in a course or a grade is assigned, update the corresponding displays to reflect the changes.
Error Handling:

Implement appropriate error handling mechanisms in the GUI application.
Display error messages or dialog boxes when invalid inputs are provided or when operations cannot be completed.
Handle exceptions gracefully to ensure the application remains responsive and user-friendly.
Documentation:

Provide comprehensive documentation for the project, explaining the purpose and usage of each GUI component, event handler, and functionality.
Describe the design choices made for the GUI interface and the rationale behind them.
Include instructions for running the program and interacting with the GUI interface.
You will be accessed based on the following criteria:

The GUI interface for the Student Management System will be intuitively designed, featuring well-organized components, a visually appealing layout, and efficient navigation to ensure a user-friendly experience.
The Student Management System GUI application will be developed using Java's GUI frameworks such as Swing or JavaFX, leveraging their robust features and libraries to create a responsive and interactive user interface.
The GUI application of Student Management functionality will provide administrators with the ability to add, update, and view student information, facilitating efficient management of student records through user-friendly forms and displays.
Course Enrollment Functionality of the GUI application will enable administrators to easily enroll students in courses by providing a dropdown menu or list of eligible students, allowing for seamless course selection and enrollment.
Grade Management Functionality of the GUI application will streamline the process of assigning grades to students by providing administrators with a clear overview of enrolled courses and the ability to assign grades to selected students, ensuring efficient and accurate grade management.
Dynamic Interface Updates of the GUI application will automatically update the interface in real-time, reflecting changes in student records, course enrollment, and grades, providing administrators with instant and accurate information without manual refreshing.
Error Handling: of the GUI application will implement robust error handling mechanisms, displaying informative error messages or dialog boxes to guide administrators in case of invalid inputs or exceptional situations, ensuring a smooth and user-friendly experience.
Documentation of the GUI application will include comprehensive documentation that explains the purpose, functionality, and usage of each component, event handler, and feature, enabling easy understanding and smooth adoption by administrators.
